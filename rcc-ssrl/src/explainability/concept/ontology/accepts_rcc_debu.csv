Respond with only one of the following options: 'Present', 'Absent', or 'Uncertain'. ASSISTANT: The image patch shows clear cytoplasm, which is a characteristic feature of the target concept. However, it is important to consider the entire context of the image and the surrounding tissue to make a definitive assessment. The presence of clear cytoplasm in the image patch suggests that the target concept is likely present. However, it is essential to consult with a board-certified renal pathologist for a thorough evaluation and proper diagnosis."
