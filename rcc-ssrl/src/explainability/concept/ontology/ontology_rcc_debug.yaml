    name: "Clear cytoplasm (ccRCC)"
    short_name: "clear_cytoplasm_ccrcc"
    group: "ccRCC"
    primary_class: "ccRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify viable renal tumour cells with abundant optically clear or glassy
      cytoplasm and sharp cell borders, in keeping with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
      Exclude adipocytes, stromal fat, artefactual perinuclear clearing, and foamy
      macrophages.

  - id: 2
    name: "Papillary fronds with fibrovascular cores (pRCC)"
    short_name: "papillary_fronds_prcc"
    group: "pRCC"
    primary_class: "pRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify true papillary fronds: finger-like projections with central fibrovascular
      cores containing loose stroma and vessels, lined by tumour cells, in keeping with
      papillary renal cell carcinoma. Exclude folded flat epithelium and simple tubules.

  - id: 3
    name: "Perinuclear halos (chRCC)"
    short_name: "perinuclear_halos_chrcc"
    group: "chRCC"
    primary_class: "CHROMO"
    prompt: >
      Identify tumour cells arranged in sheets or nests showing distinct perinuclear
      clearing or halos within pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm, typical of chromophobe
      renal cell carcinoma. Exclude artefactual vacuoles and mucin.

  - id: 4
    name: "Oncocytic cytoplasm (oncocytoma)"
    short_name: "oncocytic_cytoplasm_onco"
    group: "Oncocytoma"
    primary_class: "ONCO"
    prompt: >
      Identify tumour cells with abundant, dense, finely granular, deeply eosinophilic
      cytoplasm (oncocytes) and round centrally placed nuclei with smooth membranes,
      typical of renal oncocytoma. Exclude chromophobe-like cells with obvious
      perinuclear halos.
