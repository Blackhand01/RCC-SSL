concepts:
  - id: 1
    name: "Clear cytoplasm (ccRCC)"
    short_name: "clear_cytoplasm"
    group: "ccRCC"
    primary_class: "ccRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify viable renal tumour cells with abundant optically clear or glassy cytoplasm and sharp cell borders,
      usually forming nests or alveoli. Exclude adipocytes and stromal fat, benign tubules, foamy macrophages and
      artefactual clearing. If these specific tumour cells are not clearly present, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 2
    name: "Delicate branching capillary network (ccRCC)"
    short_name: "delicate_capillary_network"
    group: "ccRCC"
    primary_class: "ccRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify a delicate, thin-walled, branching capillary network investing nests or alveoli of tumour cells,
      creating a fine chicken-wire vascular pattern typical of clear cell RCC. Exclude thick fibrous septa and large
      muscular vessels. If this fine capillary meshwork is not obvious, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 3
    name: "Papillary fronds with fibrovascular cores (pRCC)"
    short_name: "papillary_fronds"
    group: "pRCC"
    primary_class: "pRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify true papillary fronds: finger-like projections with central fibrovascular cores containing loose stroma
      and vessels, lined by one or more layers of tumour cells. Exclude folded flat epithelium, simple tubules and
      solid nests. If you only see flat or tubular epithelium without clear fibrovascular cores, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 4
    name: "Foamy macrophages in papillary cores (pRCC)"
    short_name: "foamy_macrophages"
    group: "pRCC"
    primary_class: "pRCC"
    prompt: >
      Identify clusters or sheets of foamy macrophages with finely vacuolated cytoplasm and small dense nuclei within
      papillary fibrovascular cores or lumina. Do not call clear tumour cells, necrotic debris or artefactual vacuoles
      foamy macrophages. If macrophages are sparse or ambiguous, err on absent/equivocal.

  - id: 5
    name: "Perinuclear halos (chRCC)"
    short_name: "perinuclear_halos"
    group: "chRCC"
    primary_class: "CHROMO"
    prompt: >
      Identify solid sheets or nests of tumour cells with distinct perinuclear clearing or halos surrounding the nucleus
      within pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm, typical of chromophobe RCC. Exclude random vacuoles, degenerative change
      and mucin. If halos are not a consistent, repeated pattern, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 6
    name: "Plant-cell-like borders (chRCC)"
    short_name: "plant_cell_borders"
    group: "chRCC"
    primary_class: "CHROMO"
    prompt: >
      Identify tumour cells with thick, sharply delineated polygonal cell borders creating a plant-cell or mosaic
      appearance in sheets of chromophobe RCC. Exclude indistinct thin borders of clear cell RCC or ordinary tubular
      epithelium. If borders are not clearly thick and polygonal, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 7
    name: "Oncocytic cytoplasm (oncocytoma)"
    short_name: "oncocytic_cytoplasm"
    group: "Oncocytoma"
    primary_class: "ONCO"
    prompt: >
      Identify tumour cells with abundant, dense, finely granular, deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm (oncocytes) and round,
      centrally placed nuclei with smooth membranes, typical of renal oncocytoma. Exclude chromophobe-like cells with
      obvious perinuclear halos. If the cytoplasm is not densely granular and eosinophilic, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 8
    name: "Archipelagenous architecture in oedematous stroma (oncocytoma)"
    short_name: "archipelagenous_architecture"
    group: "Oncocytoma"
    primary_class: "ONCO"
    prompt: >
      Identify round or oval nests and islands of oncocytic tumour cells scattered in loose, oedematous or myxoid stroma,
      producing an archipelagenous or archipelago-like pattern. Exclude true papillary projections and densely packed solid
      sheets without intervening stroma. If the islands in loose stroma are not clear, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 9
    name: "Coagulative tumour necrosis"
    short_name: "coagulative_necrosis"
    group: "Necrosis"
    primary_class: null
    prompt: >
      Identify areas of coagulative tumour necrosis characterised by ghost outlines of tumour cells with loss of nuclei,
      increased eosinophilia and granular debris, usually sharply demarcated from viable tumour. Exclude simple haemorrhage,
      cyst contents, autolysis and cautery artefact. If the changes are subtle or purely haemorrhagic, treat the concept as absent.

  - id: 10
    name: "Sarcomatoid / rhabdoid dedifferentiation"
    short_name: "sarcomatoid_rhabdoid_dedifferentiation"
    group: "Dedifferentiation"
    primary_class: null
    prompt: >
      Identify high-grade dedifferentiation within renal cell carcinoma composed of malignant spindle cells in fascicles
      (sarcomatoid) and/or rhabdoid cells with eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli and dense eosinophilic cytoplasmic
      inclusions. Exclude benign stromal spindle cells and inflammatory infiltrates. If definite sarcomatoid or rhabdoid
      morphology is not obvious, treat the concept as absent.
